\f0\fs24 \cf0 EECE 5830: Network Design \
Project Phase 4: Implement RDT 3.0 over an unreliable UDP channel with bit-errors and loss\
Author: Aswin Kumar Manickam, 01624359.\
\
File Submitted:\
	1. Server.py\
	2. Client.py\
	3. Globals.py\
	4. Functions.py\
	5. Send_Receive.py\
	6. Lion.jpg\
\
Purpose of Each file:\
	1. Server.py has the main program for the server to receive a file.\
	2. Client.py has the main program for the client to send a file.\
	3. Globals.py has the common variables for both server and client.\
	4. Functions.py has the functions for checksum, file size, number of time loop has to run, Bit-error condition, data corruption, make packet, extracting packet.\
	5. Send_Receive.py has the RDT protocol for server and client to send/receive file with sequence number, checksum along with the data.\
	6. Lion.jpg is the image file for transmission.\
\
Program Execution:\
	BIT-ERROR\
	1. There is an variable E_prob which the error probability in the server side and client side.\
	2. Error probability in the SERVER side refers to the DATA-corruption. (Set E_prob in server side alone if you need to see only data corruption.)\
	3. Error probability in the CLIENT side refers to the ACK-corruption.	(Set E_prob in client side alone if you need to see only Ack corruption.)\
	4. Set E_Prob from minimum of 0 (No-error) to maximum of 99 (99% chance of corrupting the data).\
\
	PACKET LOSS\
	1. There is an variable P_Drop which the packet dropping probability in the server side and client side.\
	2. Packet dropping probability in the SERVER side refers to the DATA-Packet Loss. (Set P_Drop in server side alone if you need to see only data packet loss.)\
	3. Packet dropping probability in the CLIENT side refers to the ACK-Packet Loss. (Set P_Drop in client side alone if you need to see only Ack packet loss.)\
	4. Set P_Drop from minimum of 0 (No-error) to maximum of 99 (99% chance of Packet Loss).\
\
	After Bit_Error or Packet_Loss value is given \
	1. Run Server.py first.\
	2. Run Client.py next and you can see file transfer starts.\
	3. Check Server.py console again to make sure data has been transferred successfully.\
	Note: Execution time \'91start-time\'92 is given in global variable.\
